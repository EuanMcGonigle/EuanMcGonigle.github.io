I am the author and maintainer of some R packages accompanying some of my research. These are available on CRAN from the links below. 

* [CptNonPar](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CptNonPar): Nonparametric change point detection for multivariate time series, accompanying software for the article ["Nonparametric data segmentation in multivariate time series via joint characteristic functions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07581).

* [TrendLSW](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TrendLSW): Wavelet methods for analysing locally stationary time series, accompanying software for the articles ["Trend locally stationary wavelet processes"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jtsa.12643) and ["Modelling time-varying first and second-order structure of time series via wavelets and differencing"](https://doi.org/10.1214/22-EJS2044).
