I am a Lecturer in Statistics in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/school-of-mathematical-sciences)and the [Southampton Statistical Sciences Research Institute](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/s3ri) at the University of Southampton. 

Previously, I was a research associate in statistics at the Institute for Statistical Science at the University of Bristol, where I worked with [Dr. Haeran Cho](https://sites.google.com/view/haeran-cho/home). Before that, I did my PhD at the [STOR-i centre for doctoral training](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) at Lancaster University. I was supervised by [Rebecca Killick](https://www.lancs.ac.uk/~killick/) (Lancaster University), [Matt Nunes](https://people.bath.ac.uk/man54/homepage.html) (University of Bath), and Martyn Byng ([Numerical Algorithms Group](https://nag.com)).

I am broadly interested in developing statistical methods, modells, theory and algorithms for the analysis of nonstationary time series. My research interests include:

- multiscale methodology 

- change point detection

- nonstationary time series analysis

- wavelet methods.
