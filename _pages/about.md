I am a research associate in statistics at the Institute for Statistical Science at the University of Bristol. I currently work with [Dr. Haeran Cho](https://sites.google.com/view/haeran-cho/home) on change point problems in nonstationary time series. Before that, I did my PhD at the [STOR-i centre for doctoral training](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) at Lancaster University. I was supervised by [Rebecca Killick](https://www.lancs.ac.uk/~killick/) (Lancaster University), [Matt Nunes](https://people.bath.ac.uk/man54/homepage.html) (University of Bath), and Martyn Byng ([Numerical Algorithms Group](https://nag.com)).

My research interests include:

- multiscale methodology 

- change point detection

- nonstationary time series

- wavelet methods.
